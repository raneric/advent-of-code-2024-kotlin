# Advent of Code Kotlin Template

[Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-five days.
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provides any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.

In this repository, I will provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.
